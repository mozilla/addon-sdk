The `windows` module provides easy access to browser windows, their
tabs, and open/close related functions and events.

This module currently only supports browser windows and does not provide
access to non-browser windows such as the Bookmarks Library, preferences
or other non-browser windows created via add-ons.

Introduction
------------

Properties
----------

<api name="browserWindows">
@property {object}

An object that contains various properties and methods to access
functionality from browser windows, such as opening new windows, accessing
their tabs or switching the current active window. These properties and
methods are described below.
</api>


Properties of browserWindows
----------------------------

<api name="activeWindow">
@property {object}

The currently active window.  This property can be set to a `window` object,
which will focus that window and bring it to the foreground.
</api>

**Example**

    // get
    var windows = require("windows");
    console.log("title of active window is " + 
                windows.browserWindows.activeWindow.title);

    // set
    windows.activeWindow = anotherWindow;

<api name="browserWindows">
@property {array}

The set of open browser windows
</api>

**Example**

    var windows = require("windows");
    for each (var window in windows.browserWindows) {
      console.log(window.title);
    }

    console.log(windows.browserWindows.length);

Functions of browserWindows
---------------------------

<api name="openWindow">
@method
Open a new window.

@param options {object}
An object containing configurable options for how this window will be opened,
as well as a callback for being notified when the window has fully opened.

If the only option being used is `url`, then a bare string URL can be passed to
`openWindow` instead of specifying it as a property of the `options` object.

@prop url {string}
String URL to be opened in the new window.
This is a required property.

@prop [onOpen] {function}
A callback function that is called when the window has opened. This does not
mean that the URL content has loaded, only that the window itself is fully
functional and its properties can be accessed. This is an optional property.

@prop [onClose] {function}
A callback function that is called when the window will be called.
This is an optional property.

@prop [onReady] {function}
A callback function that is called when the URL content has loaded. This is an
optional property.
</api>

**Example**

    var windows = require("windows").browserWindows;

    // open a new window
    windows.openWindow("http://www.mysite.com");

    // an onOpen listener
    windows.openWindow({
      url: "http://www.mysite.com",
      onOpen: function(window) {
        // do stuff like listen for content
        // loading.
      }
    });

Events of browserWindows
------------------------

Events representing common actions and state changes for windows.
Listeners are passed the `window` object that triggered the event.

**open**  
Called when a new window is opened.

**close**  
Called when a window is closed.

**Examples**

    var windows = require("windows").browserWindows;

    // listen for window openings via property assignment
    windows.on('open', function(window) {
      myOpenWindows.push(window);
    });

    // modify the DOM of the page when ready,
    // by adding listener to the event collection.
    windows.on('close', function(window) {
      console.log("A window was closed.");
    });

Window
------

A `window` object represents a single open window. It contains the following
window properties and methods:

<api name="title">
@property {string}
The current title of the window. Usually the title of the active tab,
plus an app identifier.
This property is read-only.
</api>

<api name="tabs">
@property {object}
An object representing all the open tabs on the window. This object
has all the properties and methods of the `tabs` module.
This property is read-only.
</api>

<api name="focus">
@method
Makes window active
</api>

<api name="close">
@method 
Close the window.

@param callback {function}
A function to be called when the window finishes its closing process.
</api>


**Examples**

    var windows = require("windows").browserWindows;

    //Print how many tabs the current window has
    console.log("The active window has " +
                windows.activeWindow.tabs.length +
                " tabs.");

    // Print the title of all browser windows
    for each (var window in windows) {
      console.log(window.title);
    }

    // close the active window
    windows.activeWindow.close();

    // close the active window
    windows.activeWindow.close(function() {
      console.log("The active window was closed");
    });
