The `panel` module creates floating modal "popup dialogs" that appear on top of
web content and browser chrome and persist until dismissed by users or programs.
Panels are useful for presenting temporary interfaces to users in a way that is
easier for users to ignore and dismiss than a modal dialog, since panels are
hidden the moment users interact with parts of the application interface outside
them.

Introduction
------------

The module exports a constructor function, `Panel`, and two other functions,
`add` and `remove`.

`Panel` constructs a new panel.  `add` registers a panel, loading its content
and preparing it to be shown when its `show` method is invoked.  `remove`
unregisters a panel, unloading the content that was loaded in it.

A panel's content is loaded as soon as it is added, before the panel is shown,
and the content remains loaded when a panel is hidden, so it is possible
to keep a panel around in the background, updating its content as appropriate
in preparation for the next time it is shown.

Panels can be anchored to a particular element in a DOM window, including both
chrome elements, i.e. parts of the host application interface, and content
elements, i.e. parts of a web page in an application tab.  Panels that are
anchored to an element should have an arrow that points from the panel to the
element, but that has not yet been implemented.  The work to implement it is
tracked in bug 554937.

Panels have associated content scripts, which are JavaScript scripts that have
access to the content loaded into the panels.  Programs can specify one or more
content scripts to load for a panel, and the program can communicate with those
scripts via an asynchronous message passing API.

Examples
--------

Create and show a simple panel with content from the `data/` directory:

    const panels = require("panel");
    const data = require("self").data;
    let panel = panels.add(panels.Panel({
      contentURL: data.url("foo.html")
    }));
    
    panel.show();

The following code creates a widget that opens a panel containing the mobile
version of Reddit.  The panel has an associated content script (see below)
that intercepts clicks on the titles of stories and passes their URLs to the
panel object, which loads them in new tabs, so users can load each story they
want to read in a new tab by clicking on the stories' titles.

    const widgets = require("widget");
    const panels = require("panel");
    const data = require("self").data;
    
    widgets.add(widgets.Widget({
      label: "Reddit",
      image: "http://www.reddit.com/static/favicon.ico",
      panel: panels.Panel({
        width: 240,
        height: 320,
        contentURL: "http://www.reddit.com/.mobile?keep_extension=True",
        contentScriptURL: [data.url("jquery-1.4.2.min.js"),
                           data.url("panel.js")],
        contentScriptWhen: "ready",
        onMessage: function(message) {
          require("tab-browser").addTab(message);
        }
      })
    }));

This is the content script that intercepts the link clicks.  It uses jQuery,
which was also loaded as a content script, to interact with the DOM of the page.

    $(window).click(function (event) {
      var t = event.target;
      
      // Don't intercept the click if it isn't on a link.
      if (t.nodeName != "A")
        return;
      
      // Don't intercept the click if it was on one of the links in the header
      // or next/previous footer, since those links should load in the panel
      // itself.
      if ($(t).parents('#header').length || $(t).parents('.nextprev').length)
        return;
      
      // Intercept the click, passing it to the addon, which will load it in
      // a tab.
      event.stopPropagation();
      event.preventDefault();
      postMessage(t.toString());
    });

See the `examples/reddit-panel` directory for the complete example (including
the content script containing jQuery).
