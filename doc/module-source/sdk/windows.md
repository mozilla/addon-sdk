The `windows` module provides easy access to browser windows, their
tabs, and open/close related functions and events.

This module currently only supports browser windows and does not provide
access to non-browser windows such as the Bookmarks Library, preferences
or other non-browser windows created via add-ons.

<api name="browserWindows">
@property {List}
An object that contains various properties and methods to access
functionality from browser windows, such as opening new windows, accessing
their tabs or switching the current active window.

`browserWindows` provides access to all the currently open browser windows:

    var windows = require("sdk/windows");
    for each (var window in windows.browserWindows) {
      console.log(window.title);
    }

    console.log(windows.browserWindows.length);

Object emits all the events listed under "Events" section.

####Examples####

    var windows = require("sdk/windows").browserWindows;

    // add a listener to the 'open' event
    windows.on('open', function(window) {
      myOpenWindows.push(window);
    });

    // add a listener to the 'close' event
    windows.on('close', function(window) {
      console.log("A window was closed.");
    });

    // add a listener to the 'activate' event
    windows.on('activate', function(window) {
      console.log("A window was activated.");
    });

    // add a listener to the 'deactivate' event
    windows.on('deactivate', function(window) {
      console.log("A window was deactivated.");
    });


<api name="activeWindow">
@property {BrowserWindow}

The currently active window. This property is read-only.

**Example**

    // get
    var windows = require("sdk/windows");
    console.log("title of active window is " +
                windows.browserWindows.activeWindow.title);

    anotherWindow.activate();
    // set
    windows.activeWindow == anotherWindow // true
</api>

</api>

<api name="open">
@function
Open a new window.

    var windows = require("sdk/windows").browserWindows;

    // Open a new window.
    windows.open("http://www.example.com");

    // Open a new window and set a listener for "open" event.
    windows.open({
      url: "http://www.example.com",
      onOpen: function(window) {
        // do stuff like listen for content
        // loading.
      }
    });

Returns the window that was opened:

    var widgets = require("sdk/widget");
    var windows = require("sdk/windows").browserWindows;

    var example = windows.open("http://www.example.com");

    var widget = widgets.Widget({
      id: "close-window",
      label: "Close window",
      contentURL: "http://www.mozilla.org/favicon.ico",
      onClick: function() {
        example.close();
      }
    });

@param options {object}
An object containing configurable options for how this window will be opened,
as well as a callback for being notified when the window has fully opened.

If the only option being used is `url`, then a bare string URL can be passed to
`open` instead of specifying it as a property of the `options` object.

@prop url {string}
String URL to be opened in the new window.
This is a required property.

@prop isPrivate {boolean}
Boolean which will determine if a private window should be opened.
Private browsing mode must be supported in order to do this.
See the [private-browsing](modules/sdk/private-browsing.html) documentation for more information.

@prop [onOpen] {function}
A callback function that is called when the window has opened. This does not
mean that the URL content has loaded, only that the window itself is fully
functional and its properties can be accessed. This is an optional property.

@prop [onClose] {function}
A callback function that is called when the window will be called.
This is an optional property.

@prop [onActivate] {function}
A callback function that is called when the window is made active.
This is an optional property.

@prop [onDeactivate] {function}
A callback function that is called when the window is made inactive.
This is an optional property.

@returns {BrowserWindow}
</api>

<api name="BrowserWindow">
@class
A `BrowserWindow` instance represents a single open window. They can be
retrieved from the `browserWindows` property exported by this module.

    var windows = require("sdk/windows").browserWindows;

    //Print how many tabs the current window has
    console.log("The active window has " +
                windows.activeWindow.tabs.length +
                " tabs.");

    // Print the title of all browser windows
    for each (var window in windows) {
      console.log(window.title);
    }

    windows.activeWindow.close(function() {
      console.log("The active window was closed");
    });
