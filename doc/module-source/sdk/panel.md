This module exports a single constructor function `Panel` which constructs a
new panel.

A panel is a dialog. Its content is specified as HTML and you can
execute scripts in it, so the appearance and behaviour of the panel
is limited only by what you can do using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The screenshot below shows a panel whose content is built from the
list of currently open tabs:

<img class="image-center" src="static-files/media/screenshots/panel-tabs-osx.png"
alt="Simple panel example">

Panels are useful for presenting temporary interfaces to users in a way that is
easier for users to ignore and dismiss than a modal dialog, since panels are
hidden the moment users interact with parts of the application interface outside
them.

A panel's content is loaded as soon as it is created, before the panel is shown,
and the content remains loaded when a panel is hidden, so it is possible
to keep a panel around in the background, updating its content as appropriate
in preparation for the next time it is shown.

Your add-on can receive notifications when a panel is shown or hidden by
listening to its `show` and `hide` events.

## Panel Content ##

The panel's content is specified as HTML, which is loaded from the URL
supplied in the `contentURL` option to the panel's constructor.

You can load remote HTML into the panel:

    var panel = require("sdk/panel").Panel({
      width: 180,
      height: 180,
      contentURL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jetpack&useformat=mobile"
    });

    panel.show();

<img class="image-center" src="static-files/media/screenshots/wikipedia-jetpack-panel.png"
alt="Wikipedia Jetpack panel">

You can also load HTML that's been packaged with your add-on, and this is
most probably how you will create dialogs. To do this, save
the HTML in your add-on's `data` directory and load it using the `data.url()`
method exported by the
[`self`](modules/sdk/self.html) module, like this:

    var panel = require("sdk/panel").Panel({
      contentURL: require("sdk/self").data.url("myFile.html")
    });

    panel.show();

## Updating Panel Content ##

You can update the panel's content simply by setting the panel's `contentURL`
property.

Here's an add-on that adds two widgets to the add-on bar, one which
shows Google's mobile site and one which shows Bing's mobile site. The widgets
share a panel object, and switch between the two sites by updating the panel's
`contentURL` property:

    var panel = require("sdk/panel").Panel({
      contentURL: "about:blank",
      onHide: function () {
        panel.contentURL = "about:blank";
      }
    });

    require("sdk/widget").Widget({
      id: "bing",
      label: "Bing",
      contentURL: "http://www.bing.com/favicon.ico",
      panel: panel,
      onClick: function() {
        panel.contentURL = "http://m.bing.com/";
      }
    });

    require("sdk/widget").Widget({
      id: "google",
      label: "Google",
      contentURL: "http://www.google.com/favicon.ico",
      panel: panel,
      onClick: function() {
        panel.contentURL = "http://www.google.com/xhtml";
      }
    });

## Scripting Panel Content ##

You can't directly access your panel's content from your main add-on code.
To access the panel's content, you need to load a script into the panel.
In the SDK these scripts are called "content scripts" because they're
explicitly used for interacting with web content.

While content scripts can access the content they're attached to, they can't
use the SDK's APIs. So implementing a complete solution usually means you
have to send messages between the content script and the main add-on code.

* You can specify one or more content scripts to load into a panel using the
`contentScript` or `contentScriptFile` options to the
[`Panel()` constructor](modules/sdk/panel.html#Panel%28options%29).

* You can communicate with the script using either the
[`postMessage()`](dev-guide/guides/content-scripts/using-postmessage.html)
API or (preferably, usually) the
[`port`](dev-guide/guides/content-scripts/using-port.html) API.

For example, here's an add-on whose content script intercepts mouse clicks
on links inside the panel, and sends the target URL to the main add-on
code. The content script sends messages using `self.port.emit()` and the
add-on script receives them using `panel.port.on()`.

    var myScript = "window.addEventListener('click', function(event) {" +
                   "  var t = event.target;" +
                   "  if (t.nodeName == 'A')" +
                   "    self.port.emit('click-link', t.toString());" +
                   "}, false);"

    var panel = require("sdk/panel").Panel({
      contentURL: "http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/index.html",
      contentScript: myScript
    });

    panel.port.on("click-link", function(url) {
      console.log(url);
    });

    panel.show();

This example uses `contentScript` to supply the script as a string. It's
usually better practice to use `contentScriptFile`, which is a URL pointing
to a script file saved under your add-on's `data` directory.

<div class="warning">
<p>Unless your content script is extremely simple and consists only of a
static string, don't use <code>contentScript</code>: if you do, you may
have problems getting your add-on approved on AMO.</p>
<p>Instead, keep the script in a separate file and load it using
<code>contentScriptFile</code>. This makes your code easier to maintain,
secure, debug and review.</p>
</div>

### Getting User Input ###

The following add-on adds a widget which displays a panel when
clicked. The panel just contains a `<textarea>` element: when the user
presses the `return` key, the contents of the `<textarea>` is sent to the
main add-on code.

The add-on consists of three files:

* **`main.js`**: the main add-on code, that creates the widget and panel
* **`get-text.js`**: the content script that interacts with the panel content
* **`text-entry.html`**: the panel content itself, specified as HTML

"main.js" is saved in your add-on's `lib` directory, and the other two files
go in your add-on's `data` directory:

<pre>
my-addon/
         data/
              get-text.js
              text-entry.html
         lib/
             main.js
</pre>

The "main.js" looks like this:

    var data = require("sdk/self").data;

    // Create a panel whose content is defined in "text-entry.html".
    // Attach a content script called "get-text.js".
    var text_entry = require("sdk/panel").Panel({
      width: 212,
      height: 200,
      contentURL: data.url("text-entry.html"),
      contentScriptFile: data.url("get-text.js")
    });

    // Send the content script a message called "show" when
    // the panel is shown.
    text_entry.on("show", function() {
      text_entry.port.emit("show");
    });

    // Listen for messages called "text-entered" coming from
    // the content script. The message payload is the text the user
    // entered.
    // In this implementation we'll just log the text to the console.
    text_entry.port.on("text-entered", function (text) {
      console.log(text);
      text_entry.hide();
    });

    // Create a widget, and attach the panel to it, so the panel is
    // shown when the user clicks the widget.
    require("sdk/widget").Widget({
      label: "Text entry",
      id: "text-entry",
      contentURL: "http://www.mozilla.org/favicon.ico",
      panel: text_entry
    });

The content script "get-text.js" looks like this:

    self.port.on("show", function (arg) {
      var textArea = document.getElementById('edit-box');
      textArea.focus();
      // When the user hits return, send a message to main.js.
      // The message payload is the contents of the edit box.
      textArea.onkeyup = function(event) {
        if (event.keyCode == 13) {
          // Remove the newline.
          text = textArea.value.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm,"");
          self.port.emit("text-entered", text);
          textArea.value = '';
        }
      };
    });

Finally, the "text-entry.html" file defines the `<textarea>` element:

<pre class="brush: html">

&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;style type="text/css" media="all"&gt;
    textarea {
      margin: 10px;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;textarea rows="10" cols="20" id="edit-box">&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

[Working with Content Scripts](dev-guide/guides/content-scripts/index.html)
guide.

<h3>Scripting Trusted Panel Content</h3>

We've already seen that you can package HTML files in your add-on's `data`
directory and use them to define the panel's content. We can call this
"trusted" content, because unlike content loaded from a source outside the
add-on, the add-on author knows exactly what it's doing. To
interact with trusted content you don't need to use content scripts:
you can just include a script from the HTML file in the normal way, using
`script` tags.

Like a content script, these scripts can communicate with the add-on code
using the
[`postMessage()`](dev-guide/guides/content-scripts/using-postmessage.html)
API or the
[`port`](dev-guide/guides/content-scripts/using-port.html) API.
The crucial difference is that these scripts access the `postMessage`
and `port` objects through the `addon` object, whereas content scripts
access them through the `self` object.

To show the difference, we can easily convert the `text-entry` add-on above
to use normal page scripts instead of content scripts.

The main add-on code is exactly the same as the main add-on code in the
previous example, except that we don't attach a content script:

    var data = require("sdk/self").data;

    // Create a panel whose content is defined in "text-entry.html".
    var text_entry = require("sdk/panel").Panel({
      width: 212,
      height: 200,
      contentURL: data.url("text-entry.html"),
    });

    // Send the page script a message called "show" when
    // the panel is shown.
    text_entry.on("show", function() {
      text_entry.port.emit("show");
    });

    // Listen for messages called "text-entered" coming from
    // the page script. The message payload is the text the user
    // entered.
    // In this implementation we'll just log the text to the console.
    text_entry.port.on("text-entered", function (text) {
      console.log(text);
      text_entry.hide();
    });

    // Create a widget, and attach the panel to it, so the panel is
    // shown when the user clicks the widget.
    require("sdk/widget").Widget({
      label: "Text entry",
      id: "text-entry",
      contentURL: "http://www.mozilla.org/favicon.ico",
      panel: text_entry
    });

The page script is exactly the same as the content script above, except
that instead of `self`, we use `addon` to access the messaging APIs:

    addon.port.on("show", function (arg) {
      var textArea = document.getElementById('edit-box');
      textArea.focus();
      // When the user hits return, send a message to main.js.
      // The message payload is the contents of the edit box.
      textArea.onkeyup = function(event) {
        if (event.keyCode == 13) {
          // Remove the newline.
          text = textArea.value.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm,"");
          addon.port.emit("text-entered", text);
          textArea.value = '';
        }
      };
    });

Finally, the HTML file now references "get-text.js" inside a `script` tag:

<pre class="brush: html">

&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;style type="text/css" media="all"&gt;
    textarea {
      margin: 10px;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;script src="get-text.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;textarea rows="10" cols="20" id="edit-box">&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

## Styling Trusted Panel Content ##

When the panel's content is specified using an HTML file in your `data`
directory, you can style it using CSS, either embedding the CSS directly
in the file or referencing a CSS file stored under `data`.

The panel's default style is different for each operating system:

<img class="image-center" src="static-files/media/screenshots/panel-default-style.png"
alt="OS X panel default style">

This helps to ensure that the panel's style is consistent with the dialogs
displayed by Firefox and other applications, but means you need to take care
when applying your own styles. For example, if you set the panel's
`background-color` property to `white` and do not set the `color` property,
then the panel's text will be invisible on OS X although it looks fine on Ubuntu.

<api name="Panel">
@class
The Panel object represents a floating modal dialog that can by an add-on to
present user interface content.

Once a panel object has been created it can be shown and hidden using its
`show()` and `hide()` methods. Once a panel is no longer needed it can be
deactivated using `destroy()`.

The content of a panel is specified using the `contentURL` option. An add-on
can interact with the content of a panel using content scripts which it
supplies in the `contentScript` and/or `contentScriptFile` options. For example,
a content script could create a menu and send the user's selection to the
add-on.
