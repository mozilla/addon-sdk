# High-Level APIs #

Modules in this section implement high-level APIs for
building add-ons:

* creating user interfaces
* interacting with the web
* interacting with the browser

Unless the documentation explicitly says otherwise, all these modules are
"supported": meaning that they are relatively stable, and that we'll avoid
making incompatible changes to them unless absolutely necessary.
