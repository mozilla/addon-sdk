# Two Types of Scripts #

On the web, JavaScript executes in the context of a web page, and has access to
that page's DOM content. This enables you to call functions like:

    window.alert("Hello there");

In an add-on's main scripts you can't do that, because the add-on code does
not execute in the context of a page, and the DOM is therefore not available.
If you need to access the DOM of a particular page, you need to use a
content script.

So there are two distinct sorts of JavaScript scripts you might include
in your add-on and they have access to different sets of APIs. In the SDK
documentation we call one sort "add-on code" and the other sort "content
scripts".

## Add-on Code ##

This is the place where the main logic of your add-on is implemented.

Your add-on is implemented as a collection of one or more
[CommonJS modules](dev-guide/addon-development/commonjs.html). Each module
is supplied as a script stored under the `lib` directory under your add-on's
root directory.

Minimally you'll have a single module implemented by a script called
"main.js", but you can include additional modules in `lib`, and import them
using the `require()` function. To learn how to implement and import your own
modules, see the tutorial on
[Implementing Reusable Modules](dev-guide/addon-development/implementing-reusable-module.html).

## Content Scripts ##

While your add-on will always have a "main.js" module, you will only need
to write content scripts if your add-on needs to manipulate web content.
Content scripts are injected into web pages using APIs defined by some of the
SDK's modules such as `page-mod`, `panel` and `widget`.

Content scripts may be supplied as literal strings or maintained in separate
files and referenced by filename. If they are stored in separate files you
should store them under the `data` directory under your add-on's root.

To learn all about content scripts read the
[Working with Content Scripts](dev-guide/addon-development/web-content.html)
guide.

## API Access for Add-on Code and Content Scripts ##

The table below summarizes the APIs that are available to each type of
script.

If <code>require()</code> is available, then so are the modules supplied in the
SDK. See this
